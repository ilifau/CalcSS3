# Calculator - CalcSS3

A joined version of Peter Dematt√©'s fine calculator with extensions from DIPFtba .<br>


It features the original layout and includes a representation of the current expression below the main display.
Apart from that the functionality has not been altered, so you can refer to the original documentation: [Using the Calculator](http://dematte.at/calculator#usage).
